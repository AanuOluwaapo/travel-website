## INTRODUCTION
This project is a website project aimed at having a beautiful website for a travel agency. The images, choice of color and font are carefully chosen so that they can be attractive enough to captivate travellers. The website is made responsive so that travellers who visit the website can navigate the platform well without any hassle.

## LIVE DEMO 
You can look up my travel website on Here is the link:

## SECTIONS
My website has a header, four sections and one footer. The essence of this careful segmentation is to help travellers locate easily whatever aspects interest them.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED 
- CSS
- HTML
- YouTube: Because this is a task, I watched a lot of YouTube videos to be able to complete this task effectively.
- CSS Grid: I used the CSS Grid so that the website can be responsive both for mobile and desktop because I started with the mobile view.

## INSTALLATION AND SET-UP 
There is no special setup and installation. Once you search for the website online, all you need to do is proceed to explore the website.
